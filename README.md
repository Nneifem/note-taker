# note-taker

## Description

This webpage was created in order to take notes for whatever you want to use it for, whether it be little reminders for you throughout the day or to use it for class, it'll help you keep everything in check. This solves the problem of having to waste paper to take notes and have a handy, good place to keep all your notes orgranized however you like. It helped me learn how to use express, further my understanding of using node, and how html, css, and javascript are slowly all coming together to help the page interactive with the user by using routes.


## Installation

In order to get this to work properly, you will need to install Node js. v16 and express. To do so, open VS Code and in the integrated terminal, type npm init -y and npm i for the packages and npm i express --save to install express.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
