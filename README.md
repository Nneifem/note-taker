# note-taker

## Description

This webpage was created in order to take notes for whatever you want to use it for, whether it be little reminders for you throughout the day or to use it for class, it'll help you keep everything in check. This solves the problem of having to waste paper to take notes and have a handy, good place to keep all your notes orgranized however you like. It helped me learn how to use express, further my understanding of using node, and how html, css, and javascript are slowly all coming together to help the page interactive with the user by using routes.


## Installation

In order to get this to work properly, you will need to install Node js. v16 and express. To do so, open VS Code and in the integrated terminal, type npm init -y and npm i for the packages and npm i express --save to install express.

## Usage

When you first open the webpage you are greeted with the home page of 'Note Taker', 'Take notes with Express', with a blue button saying 'Get Started'. After you click the button, your saved notes are on the left hand side, to write notes are on the center, and to add or save notes is on the right hand corner of the page. When the user finishes typing a title and their notes, then click the save button and their note will be saved. If the user decides to delete their notes, then they can click the red trash can to remove it and to add more.
